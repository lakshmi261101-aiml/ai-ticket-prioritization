# ðŸŽ« AI Ticket Prioritization System

## Whatâ€™s This About?

This project is a smart support ticket system for IT helpdesks. It uses a little AI magic to automatically figure out the category of each issue (network, hardware, software, etc.) and how urgent it is. It helps teams prioritize, assign, and track tickets efficiently â€” no more lost urgent requests!

It also lets you bulk import tickets from CSV files, keeps a full history of changes, and shows cool dashboard stats and analytics so managers know how the team is doing.

## Why Does This Matter?

Handling support tickets manually can be slow and messy. Important issues might get overlooked while less urgent ones get attention. This tool automates classification and keeps everything transparent, so things get fixed faster and smarter.

## What Technologies Did We Use?

- **Python** - main programming language
- **Streamlit** - for building the web app interface
- **SQLite** - lightweight database to store users & tickets
- **Pandas** - for handling CSV imports/exports and data
- **Plotly Express** - to create interactive charts
- **Hashlib** - to securely hash user passwords
- **Datetime** - to calculate SLA deadlines and track ticket resolution times
